# Project Structure

This document outlines the structure of the CUDA CMake project.

## Directory Layout

```
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
│   └── kernel.h
├── src
│   ├── kernel.cu
│   └── main.cpp
├── tests
│   └── kernel_test.cpp
└── build/
    └── bin/
```

## File Descriptions

*   `CMakeLists.txt`: The main CMake script that defines the project, finds the CUDA toolkit, and configures the build process.
*   `include/kernel.h`: Header file for the CUDA kernel code. It declares the functions that are implemented in `.cu` files but can be called from `.cpp` files.
*   `src/kernel.cu`: The CUDA source file containing the kernel implementation (`hello_kernel`) and the wrapper function (`launch_kernel`) to launch it.
*   `src/main.cpp`: The C++ entry point of the application. It calls the `launch_kernel` function to execute the CUDA code.
*   `tests/kernel_test.cpp`: The C++ file containing the GoogleTest unit tests for the CUDA kernel.
*   `build/`: This directory is created to store the build files generated by CMake and the final executable. It is kept separate from the source code.

## How to Build

This project is configured to be built with Ninja. To build and run the application, execute the following commands from the project root directory:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja ..
ninja
./bin/app
```

To run the tests, execute the following command from the `build` directory:

```bash
ctest
```

## User Preferences

*   The `build` directory should be created and configured with CMake only once. Do not run `cmake` again unless the build files need to be regenerated.
